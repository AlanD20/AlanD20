#### Hey there :) I'm Aland

I'm a Software Engineer and Cloud infrastructure Engineer. I work with variety of technologies and languages such as: JavaScript, PHP, Go, and many more! I have lead many complex integration projects from leading, designing, implementation, communication, and supervising throughout the project life cycle. Lately, I've been getting into DevOps/Cloud infrastructure works. Mainly working with AWS services and working on scalability, maintainability, monitoring, and logging for MicroService architecture with event-driven design with the use of Apache Kafka and Apache Cassandra for high availability and scalability.

My workspace is quite simple and it's been a learning playground to try out new utilities and tools to make my work more fun by using these small tools. Checkout my [.dotfiles](https://github.com/AlanD20/.dotfiles) for all the configuration files and workspace/laptop setup.

You may find my project here on GitHub or you may checkout my [Personal Website](https://aland20.com/) where I try to keep it up-to-date (i promise) with my most recent interesting projects.
